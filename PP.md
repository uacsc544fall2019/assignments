- URL for Feedback Form: [https://forms.gle/rGaFRjyNtEqbPYnv7](https://forms.gle/rGaFRjyNtEqbPYnv7)
- Released, 2019/11/5


Due December 1, 11:59PM

In this milestone we are:

- Practicing explaining our research to a broader audience
- Creating artifacts of the project in terms of slides
- Thinking critically about visualization and research design to provide
  feedback


Create a repository for this milestone at this following Github Classroom
link: [https://classroom.github.com/g/ZGcuHHqQ](https://classroom.github.com/g/ZGcuHHqQ)

At the deadline, a copy of your slides should be in that repository. You may
make changes to the slides later to improve them for the presentation, but the
artifact at the deadline will be factored into the grading as well. Please
upload as either PDF or PowerPoint. If you are using another program and
require movies, please use a static image in the PDF and include the movies as
auxiliary files.

### Presentation

The presentation will be 15 minutes plus an optional 5 minutes for questions
for individual projects and 20 minutes plus an optional 5 minutes for
questions for group projects. In group projects, each team member should
present approximately equal time.

The presentation should cover:

- An overview of the problem you are trying to solve and why it is important. Remember, your classmates are probably unfamiliar with it. It is worth taking some time to describe it in detail along with the data if applicable and the goals of your solution. If the audience does not understand the problem you are trying to solve and why it is important, they will not follow the rest of the  presentation.
- An overview of your solution including the design choices you made, their rationale, and how they solve the problem.

The goals of the presentation are:

- The rest of the class understands your problem and solution enough to offer you constructive criticism
- The rest of the class benefits from the knowledge you gained (about design, visualization, implementation or anything else) by doing this project.


Suggestion on presentation structure: A talk of this length **does not** require
an outline slide. If such a slide works naturally as part of a large point
and/or conveys other information it may be helpful. However, a slide with six
bulleted short phrases is not worth the time. 

### Presentation Feedback

For each presentation, answer the following questions:

- What is the goal of this project? What problem is it trying to solve and why is that problem important?
- What are the strengths of the solution?
- What in the solution could be improved and how? (Do not repeat what the presenter has already said.)

You will submit these answers in a Google Form to be given on December 2nd.
The answers are all due by 8PM on the day the presentation is given. You must
attend the presentation to submit these answers. I recommend taking notes
during the presentation and typing them up after class OR typing directly into
the form.

Your feedback in these forms will be *confidential.* They will be shared with
the teams without your name attached. Please be *constructive* in your
feedback. You will be graded individually on your how constructive your
feedback was, including the tone of the feedback.
